**This project is still under development. Please feel free to raise issues or submit pull requests to contribute to our codebase.**

Some insights about 3D CNN module is originated from [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) and the 3D Vision GNN(ViG3D) module is originated from [Vision GNN](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Efficient-AI-Backbones).

## BraTS Experiments (WIP)
The BraTS workflow is under active development with config-driven training runs. Use the dry-run config to verify the pipeline and output layout:

```bash
python -m src.train --config configs/brats/dry_run.yaml
```

The dry run writes a run folder under `runs/<exp_name>/<timestamp>/` with a config copy, environment info, and logs. It will log a single batch shape and exit.
